# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts studentsâ€™ final grades based on their academic, social, and behavioral attributes using regression models.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project uses the **UCI Student Performance Dataset** to analyze various factors like study time, parental education, health, and absences to predict final grades (`G3`). The goal is to apply **linear regression** to understand what influences student success and to visualize the prediction accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** â€“ Data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Regression modeling and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Development environment

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Dataset: [UCI Student Performance Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
- File used: `student-mat.csv`
- Target column: `G3` (final grade)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Download the dataset (`student-mat.csv`) and place it in the same directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Student_Performance_Predictor.ipynb
